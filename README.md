# basic_calculator

This repository contains my first solo project - a basic calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JS.
As I learned the basics of these languages, I wanted to practice my knowledge in building a real app.

## Supports:

Simple arithmetic calculations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, and floating points.

## Doesn't support:

Complex calculations (like a scientific calculator), negative values, or exponential values.

## To run:

Basically, open the index.html file on your browser.

## Feedbacks

Please, share with me any ideas on how I could improve the project.
